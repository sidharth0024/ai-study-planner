AI Study Planner for Engineering Students 🚀
🎯 Problem Solved
Engineering students struggle with complex subjects, prerequisites, deadlines, and limited study time. Traditional planners fail because they don't understand cognitive load, topic dependencies, and personal confidence levels.

As, I am a Full Stack Web-Developer Intern I have created a Effective Web Application based Solution on this problem.
My solution has Simple and Fast Paced UI so no Time Wastage and Easy Print Outs of the Generated Stratergy and much more features!

My solution creates SMART study plans that:

Allocate more time to weak subjects automatically

Schedule high-focus topics during your best hours

Map prerequisites so you don't get stuck

Prevent cramming with balanced daily loads

ITS 100% REAL-TIME and WORKING because I have Created it on my VS Code and Tested this on my Local Host. So it's not just lines of Code it is a ACTUAL REAL WORLD based SOLUTION. 

✨ Key Features
1. Smart Time Allocation
text
Data Structures (4 credits, confidence 3/5, 2 weak areas) → 35% time
OS (3 credits, confidence 2/5, 2 weak areas) → 28% time  
Math (4 credits, confidence 3/5, 1 weak area) → 37% time
Low confidence + more weak areas = more study time (automatic!)

2. Cognitive Load Optimizer 🧠
text
HIGH load (Trees, Deadlocks): Night sessions (your peak time)
MEDIUM load (Practice): Evening  
LOW load (Revision): Anytime
Matches study difficulty to your mental capacity

3. Prerequisite Mapping 🔗
text
Trees → BEFORE Graphs (auto-detected)
Deadlocks → AFTER Processes/Threads
Laplace → AFTER Differential Equations
Never study advanced topics without foundations

4. Daily Load Balancing ⚖️
Max 1.2 cognitive units per day (science-based)

Mix of subjects daily (no burnout)

Buffer days for unexpected delays

Weak topics spread across timeline
